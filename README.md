# DTMF Tones Generator
This project can generate DTMF tones to phone numbers. It was made in MATLAB programming language as an academic work of the Digital Signal Processing discipline (Electrical Engineering).

# Program operation
Firstly, the program asks for the user's name. Then, is asked the number that the user would like to generate as a DTMF tone. Lastly, a sound file is returned by the program, that will be saved in the same directory of the MATLAB script.

# Comments
The sound file is salved with a .wav extension. The file name will be building as follows:

## `userName_dtmfNumber.wav`

Where the userName is the input that was informed by the user to the program. This code can generate DTMF tones for any number, regardless of size.
